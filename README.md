# Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to the **Data Structures and Algorithms** repository! This repository is dedicated to my journey in mastering data structures and algorithms. The goal is to strengthen my problem-solving skills, gain a deeper understanding of different data structures, and prepare for coding interviews.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main categories: **Data Structures** and **Algorithms**. Each category is further divided into subfolders that contain specific implementations.

```bash
    Data_Structures_and_Algorithms/ 
    â”œâ”€â”€ DataStructures/ 
    â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Arrays/ 
    â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ LinkedLists/ 
    â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Stacks/ 
    â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Queues/ 
    â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Trees/ 
    â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Graphs/ 
    â”‚ â””â”€â”€ HashTables/ 
    â”œâ”€â”€ Algorithms/ 
    â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Sorting/ 
    â”‚ â””â”€â”€Searching/ 
    â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
    â”œâ”€â”€ README.md 
    â””â”€â”€ LICENSE 
```

### Folders and Content

- **DataStructures**: This directory contains implementations of various data structures. Each data structure has its own folder with specific code files.
  
- **Algorithms**: This directory includes different categories of algorithms. Each algorithm category has code files for specific algorithms.

## Getting Started

To use this repository:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AlexzGut/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms.git
    cd Data_Structures_and_Algorithms
    ```

2. **Compile and Run Code Files**:
   Each Java file can be compiled and run separately. For example:

    ```bash
    javac DataStructures/Arrays/ArrayExample.java
    java DataStructures.Arrays.ArrayExample
    ```

3. **Testing**:
   You can use JUnit to run tests in the `tests` folder. Make sure JUnit is in your classpath.

## Progress and Goals ðŸš€

- Implement foundational data structures and algorithms.
- Optimize and understand time and space complexities.
- Prepare for coding interviews by practicing common problems.

## Resources

These implementations and exercises are inspired by:
