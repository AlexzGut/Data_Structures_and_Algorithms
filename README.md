# Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to the **Data Structures and Algorithms** repository! This repository is dedicated to my journey in mastering data structures and algorithms. The goal is to strengthen my problem-solving skills, gain a deeper understanding of different data structures, and prepare for coding interviews.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main categories: **Data Structures** and **Algorithms**. Each category is further divided into subfolders that contain specific implementations.

### Folders and Content

- **DataStructures**: This directory contains implementations of various data structures. Each data structure has its own folder with specific code files.
  
- **Algorithms**: This directory includes different categories of algorithms. Each algorithm category has code files for specific algorithms.

## Getting Started

To use this repository:

**Clone the Repository**:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AlexzGut/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms.git
    cd Data_Structures_and_Algorithms
```

## Building and Running with Maven

1. **Build the Project**:
    ```bash
    mvn clean compile
    ```

2. **Run Tests**:
    ```bash
    mvn test
    ```

3. **Run Specific Class**:
   Replace `MainClass` with the actual main class name.
